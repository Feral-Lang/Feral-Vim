# About

Feral's Syntax Highlighting Extension for (Neo)vim

# Installation

## Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

In your `.vimrc`/`init.vim`, add the following:
```
" Plugin for Feral support
Plug 'Feral-Lang/Feral-Vim'
```

Open (Neo)vim, and install the plugin using `:PlugInstall`. That's it!

Now you can open any file in (Neo)vim with `.fer` extension and the Feral syntax highlighting should work!
If it doesn't perhaps restart (Neo)vim. Still doesn't? Kindly create an issue!
